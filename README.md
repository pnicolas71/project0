Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a homepage that talks about myself with some of my personal pictures.

It has 5 html pages:

- Index.html : acts like a cover page with some of my countryside pictures and a family picture
- who.html : it gives some personal information about me to know more about my origins and background.
- family.html : it talks about my closest family members: Wife, daugther, parents, siblings, etc.
- taste.html : says much about my hobbies
- work.html : is kind of a CV that speaks about my career.

It covers all the requirements:

- 4 different .html pages - view points above.
- Your website must include at least one list (the list of countrie visited in hobbies) , at least one table (table of language skills - page who?), and at least one image (there are plenty).
- Your website must have at least one stylesheet file (The style.css in the route directory).
- Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once (requirements met)
- Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens. (the family picture in the family html page doesn't show on phone screen neither is printed)
- You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model (the navigation bar and the 2 columns of the pages are bootstrap)
- Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
